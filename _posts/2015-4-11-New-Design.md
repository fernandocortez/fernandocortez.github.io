Today, I changed the design of this site to use [Yahoo's Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/).
I like that the project does not have any JavaScript files to deal with, which is
something I strive for in this blog as it's mostly HTML and CSS. I used the
[blog layout](http://purecss.io/layouts/blog/) which helped out tremendously.
